# Groan Zone
The Groan Zone is a website with a simple, blog-like layout. The content is intended to be all "dad jokes". The site is organized by posts, which can each be upvoted or downvoted by visitors.

# Description
When visitors enter the Groan Zone, they are greeted with a splash page, that shows the top five "dad jokes" of the day. From there, they can navigate to the login page, or to a page that lists all jokes, in order of chronological creation.

Visitors can register a user account, or login to a pre-existing account. Registered users can post a joke, which is then subject to upvoting and downvoting.
